# Pymaceuticals Tumor Analysis#
**Project Overview**  
This Project analyzes the effectiveness of different anti-cancer drug regimens drug retirements tested on mice  
with squamouse cell carcinoma (scc). the primary Focus on Campomulin, comparing it with other treatments.  
**key task performed**  
1.Data Cleaning: Merging datasets, removing Duplicates  
2 Summary statistics:Mean,median, varience,standard deviation, SEM for tumor volumes  
3. data Visualization:   
      . Bar Chart & Pie Chart (tumor volume distribfution,gender distribution)  
      . Box Plots(tumor volume distribution for key treatments)  
      . Line & Scatter Plots(tummor growth over time, weight vs tumor volume)  
4. Statistical Analysis: correlation & regression between mouse weight and tumor size.  

**Technology used**  
1.Python(Pandas,Matplotlib,SciPy,NumPy,Seaborn)  
2.Jupyter Notebook.  
**Insights**  
1. Capomulin showed promising tumer reduction compared to other drugs.  
2. A strong correlation was oveserved between mouse weight and tumor volume.
**How to Run**
1. Clear all the output.
2. Restart kernal.
3. Analyze the output & Visulization.
**Conclusion:**  capomulin appear to be a strong Treatment for further trials.  
5.
